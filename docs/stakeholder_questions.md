# Stakeholder Questions (examples)

## Senior Analyst / Data Manager might ask:
- Are there any **data quality issues** this month (duplicates, missing regions, invalid prices)?
- Which channels are producing the highest attendance rate?
- Which courses have the best revenue and satisfaction?

## Internal teams might ask (ad‑hoc):
- Pull all bookings for **SQL‑101** in the last 90 days
- Compare **attendance rate** by region
- Identify sessions with a **drop in rating** vs last month
